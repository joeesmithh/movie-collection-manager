## Movie Collection Manager
**Movie cataloging tool built with JavaFX, integrating IMDb data for easy searching.**<br>
This program utilizes the Internet Movie Database's (IMDB) open source .csv file to create a programmatic catalogue of every movie within their database. The user can search for any movie within the database, view associated movie art and descriptions, and add them to their movie collection (Saved Media). This process involves downloading the media's associated HTML page and scraping the HTML file for the relevant information. The program will save basic attributes of media added to the collection during runtime and reload them on program restart.
